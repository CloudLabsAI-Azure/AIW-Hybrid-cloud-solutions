1. Now switch back to Windows PowerShell and you will be able to see that you have logged in to Azure.

1. Run the below commands to install the required Azure CLI extensions.
   
   ```
   az extension add --name k8s-extension
   az extension add --name connectedk8s
   az extension add --name k8s-configuration
   az extension add --name customlocation   
   ```   
  
    ![](media/install-extensions.png "Lab Environment")
   
1. You can validate that you have all the required extensions with the latest versions by running the below command:
   
   ```
   az version
   ```     
    ![](media/version-check.png "Lab Environment")
   
1. After confirming that the required tools are installed, the next step is to register your subscription with Arc for Kubernetes.

1. Run the below commands to register the required resource providers if not already registered.

   ```
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Kubernetes
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ExtendedLocation
   ``` 
   
    ![](media/register-provider.png "Lab Environment")
   
### Task 2: Onboard an existing Kubernetes cluster to Azure using Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes

In this task, you will be connecting an existing Kubernetes cluster to Azure using Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes and will be enabling custom features by adding an Azure Arc data services extension and a custom location on the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster.


1. Run the below command to connect the existing Kubernetes to your Azure subscription using Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes. Once you have run the command, it will take a few minutes to onboard the cluster to Azure Arc.

   ```
   az connectedk8s connect --name Arc-Data-Demo-DirectMode --resource-group azure-arc
   ```
   > **Info:** In the above step, you have connected your existing Azure kubernetes cluster to Azure Arc, to get the available AKS cluster deployed on azure, you can use the command ```az aks list```.
  
   > **Note:** We have already defined your Cluster name and Azure resource group name in the above commands. If you are trying this in your subscription, please make sure that you have entered the correct details. This can take upto 5 minutes to complete. 

1. Once the previous command is executed successfully, the provisioning state in output will show as succeeded.
   
    ![](media/provisionstate.png "Lab Environment")

1. Verify whether the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster is onboarded and connected to the resource group in the Azure subscription by running the following command:

   ```
   az connectedk8s list -g azure-arc -o table
   ```  
  
    ![](media/list-table.png "Lab Environment")
   
1. Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes deploys a few operators into the azure-arc namespace. You can view these deployments and pods by running the command in the command prompt:  

    > **Note:** A Kubernetes operator is an application-specific controller that extends the functionality of the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage instances of complex applications on behalf of a Kubernetes user.

   ```
   kubectl -n azure-arc get deployments,pods
   ```
   
   The output should be similar to as shown below:    
  
    ![](media/deploy-pods.png "Lab Environment")

1. Navigate to the Resource Group from the Azure portal navigation pane and click on the Resource Group named azure-arc. Look for the resource named **Arc-Data-Demo-DirectMode** of resource type Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes resource.
  
    ![](media/azurearc-connected.png "Lab Environment")

### Create a custom location on the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster

   Custom Locations provides administrators a way to deploy Azure Arc data services and other Azure Arc-enabled services to their locations, similar to Azure locations.

1. Now run the below command to enable features to create the custom location:

     ```
     az connectedk8s enable-features -n Arc-Data-Demo-DirectMode -g azure-arc --features cluster-connect custom-locations
    
     ```
    The output should be similar to as shown below:**"Successfully enabled features: ['cluster-connect', 'custom-locations'] for the Connected Cluster Arc-Data-Demo-DirectMode"**
        
   > **Note:** The Custom Locations feature is dependent on the Cluster Connect feature. So, both the features have to be enabled for custom locations to work. Also, az connectedk8s enable-features need to be run on a machine where the kubeconfig file is pointing to the cluster on which the features are to be enabled.
    
1. Run the below command to deploy the extension of Azure Arc-enabled Data Services on the Azure Arc Kubernetes cluster.
  
     ```
    az k8s-extension create --name azdata --extension-type microsoft.arcdataservices --cluster-type connectedClusters -c Arc-Data-Demo-DirectMode -g azure-arc --scope cluster --release-namespace azure-arc --config Microsoft.CustomLocation.ServiceAccount=sa-bootstrapper
     ```
   > **Note:** The above command will take upto 5 minutes to complete the creation of azdata extension, please wait for it to complete before proceeding to the next task.

1. After running the above command you will notice that the **Provisioning State** is **Succeeded**. If it is pending, it is because the extension may take a few minutes to complete the installation.
   
    ![](media/extension-output.png "Lab Environment")

1. To verify the extension installation, switch back to the Azure Portal in the browser and search for **Kubernetes - Azure Arc** and select your cluster.

    ![](media/extension-installed.png "Lab Environment")

1. Now run the below command to get the Azure Resource Manager identifier of the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster, you will be using the cluster ID in the later steps while creating the custom location.

     ```  
     $clusterID = az connectedk8s show -n Arc-Data-Demo-DirectMode -g azure-arc  --query id -o tsv
     $clusterID
     ```
   > **Note:** The clusterID is stored in $clusterID parameter and you will be using this parameter only in the later steps.
       
    ![zx](media/clusterid.png "Lab Environment")
    
1. Now run the below command to get the Azure Resource Manager identifier of the cluster extension deployed on top of the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster, referenced in the later steps as extensionId:

     ```
     $extensionID = az k8s-extension show --name azdata --cluster-type connectedClusters -c Arc-Data-Demo-DirectMode -g azure-arc --query id -o tsv
     $extensionID
     ``` 
   > **Note:** The extension resource ID is stored in $extensionID parameter and you will be using this parameter only in the later steps.  
   
   ![sad](media/extensionid.png "Lab Environment")
    
1. Now run the below command to create a custom location by referencing the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster ID and the extension ID.

    ```  
    az customlocation create -n azurearc-nyc-location -g azure-arc --namespace azure-arc --host-resource-id $clusterID --cluster-extension-ids $extensionID
    ```
    
   > **Note:** This can take upto 2 mintues to complete the creation of custom location
